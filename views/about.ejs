      <h1>A Bit of our History</h1>
      <p>A television series in 1968 combined with the general church movement toward involvement in social issues led to the formation of the Augusta Regional Church Housing Corporation.</p>
      <p>
        Canon Roger Smith, Rector of St. Mark’s Episcopal Church invited local clergymen to a session to discuss local issues. The churches involved were St. Mark’s, South Parish Green Street Methodist, St. Augustine’s, St. Mary’s, All Souls Unitarian church, Prince of Peace Lutheran Church and three Hallowell Churches, Cox Memorial, South Parish Congregational and Sacred Heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Principally, it was Father Smith and Augusta City Manager Paul Poulin along with the Pastors of the above named churches who pushed for housing for the elderly.</p>
